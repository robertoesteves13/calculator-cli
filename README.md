# calculator-cli
Simple Calculator CLI app that you can do simple aritmethic calculations in your terminal. Made as a side project to practice Go and software development in general.
## Inspiration
This project is inspirated on repository [florinpop17/app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/Calculator-CLI.md). I highly suggest to use that as a way to practice and strenghten your programming skills!
